			<h4>Objective</h4>
			<p>After a career start as a business analyst at DST Systems, I embarked on a ten-year walkabout to learn more about our business through positions in daily support and client relationship management. Along the way, I realized I had an aptitude for the more technical aspects of the job, so I became involved with Kansas City Women in Technology, and now am on the board of directors.  As the co-director for their Coding & Cocktails program I am in a position to both learn new technical skills from other women developers and teach them to those interested in exploring a career change to programming. I am returning to business analysis to refresh my software development skills while working to build a new skill set in front end development. </p>

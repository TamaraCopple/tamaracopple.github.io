		<h4>Objective</h4>
		<p id="objective">After a career start as a business analyst at DST Systems, I embarked on a ten-year walkabout to learn more about our business through positions in daily support and client relationship management. Along the way, I realized I had an aptitude for the more technical aspects of the job, so I became involved with Kansas City Women in Technology as a mentor.  As the co-director for the Coding &amp; Cocktails program I am in a position to both learn new technical skills from other women developers and pass on that knowledge. I am returning to business analysis to refresh my software development skills while working to build a new skill set in front end development. </p>
